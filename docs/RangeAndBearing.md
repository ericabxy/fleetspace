Range and Bearing
-----------------

Units of Distance
-----------------

Distances are measured in standard units of length. A unit should be chosen based on the size of ship models and play area. A single unit is noted by the double prime symbol (&Prime;).

Fire Arcs
---------

The bearing of weapons can be described as firing arcs traversing hours on a clock face. Standard firing arcs traverse two hours (60 degrees) relative to the ship's heading (12 o'clock).

| Fore Starboard (FS)  | 1 o'clock to 3 o'clock
| Aft Starboard (AS)   | 3 o'clock to 5 o'clock
| Aft (AFT)            | 5 o'clock to 7 o'clock
| Aft Port (AP)        | 7 o'clock to 9 o'clock
| Fore Port (FP)       | 9 o'clock to 11 o'clock
| Fore (FWD)           | 11 o'clock to 1 o'clock

The arcs a battery can traverse are indicated by tic marks surrounding its symbol.
