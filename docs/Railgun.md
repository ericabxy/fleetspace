Railgun
-------

Electromagnetic accelerator fires solid penetrators at high velocity. The chance to hit a target is the same as [torpedo](Torpedo) weapons.

| At range of:
| **0-6″**   | Required score to hit: | **2** to **6**
| **6-12″**  | Required score to hit: | **3** to **6**
| **12-18″** | Required score to hit: | **4** to **6**
| **18-24″** | Required score to hit: | **5** or **6**
| **24-30″** | Required score to hit: | **6** only

For each railgun projectile that hits, there is a 50% chance it will deal damage equal to _double_ the class of the railgun. Otherwise it will deal damage equal to the class of the railgun.

| Result | Damage
| ------ | ------
| Odds   | Railgun class &times;1
| Evens  | Railgun class &times;2

A variant of the railgun damage system adjusts the occurrence of double damage according to the railgun class. When this system is used, any result equal to or lower than the railgun class AND lower than 6 deals double damage.

| Railgun Class | Damage
| :-----------: | ------
|       1       | 1 rolled = **two** damage points, otherwise **one** damage point
|       2       | 1-2 rolled = **four** damage points, otherwise **two** damage points
|       3       | 1-3 rolled = **six** damage points, otherwise **three** damage points
|       4       | 1-4 rolled = **eight** damage points, otherwise **four** damage points
|       5       | 1-5 rolled = **ten** damage points, otherwise **five** damage points
|       6       | 1-5 rolled = **twelve** damage points, otherwise **six** damage points
