The FTSymbol font is a compilation of all the system symbols for the Full 
Thrust game and More Thrust supplement, published by Ground Zero Games. I 
have created it to simplify the generation of documents for the Full 
Thrust/More Thrust game, including customized ship record sheets and 
scenario documentation.

The attached documentation (ftsymbol.doc in Word 2.x format for Windows or 
About FTSymbol Font in Word 5.1 format for Mac) contains a complete table of 
symbols in this font.  To view or print the documentation, you must install 
the font, then run Microsoft Word and open the file.

If you cannot read the documentation file, please contact me at the email
address above and I'll try to accomodate you.
