Railguns
--------

Electromagnetic accelerator fires solid penetrators at high velocity. The chance to hit a target is the same as [torpedo](Torpedo) weapons.

| At range of:
| **0-6″**   | Required score to hit: | **2** to **6**
| **6-12″**  | Required score to hit: | **3** to **6**
| **12-18″** | Required score to hit: | **4** to **6**
| **18-24″** | Required score to hit: | **5** or **6**
| **24-30″** | Required score to hit: | **6** only

For each railgun projectile that hits, damage is dealt equal to the class of the railgun. However there is a chance it will deal _double_ the damage instead. Roll another six-sided die to determine the result.

**Railgun damage:**

| Railgun Class  | 1-3 Rolled   | 4-6 Rolled
| :------------: | ------------ | ----------
|       1        | one point    | two points
|       2        | two points   | four points
|       3        | three points | six points
|       4        | four points  | eight points

* Standard defensive screens do not affect damage dealt by railguns

Advanced Screens
----------------

While standard defensive screens do not affect railgun hits or damage in any way, [advanced screens](AdvancedScreens#against-railguns) are able to reduce the chance of taking double damage.

**Railgun damage against advanced screens:**

| Screen Level 1 | 1-4 Rolled   | 5-6 Rolled
| Screen Level 2 | 1-5 Rolled   | 6 Rolled
| :------------: | ------------ | ----------
| Class 1        | one point    | two points
| Class 2        | two points   | four points
| Class 3        | three points | six points
| Class 4        | four points  | eight points
