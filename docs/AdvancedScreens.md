Advanced Screens
----------------

While normal [defensive screens](DefensiveScreens) are only designed to disrupt and dampen incoming [beam battery](BeamBatteries) fire, advanced screens are also able to deflect and intercept physical projectiles. This makes them effective against weapons that normally ignore or punch through less advanced screens.

Against Batteries
-----------------

Advanced screens work as normal defensive screens against beam batteries and advanced batteries.

Against Submuntions
-------------------

Advanced screens affect submunitions as if they were beams, taking fewer hits depending on screen level.

**Submunitions damage against advanced screens:**

| Every 5 rolled             | **One** damage point  | **One** damage point
| Every 6 rolled             | **Two** damage points | **One** damage point

Advanced screens do not affect the hit rate of [torpedoes](Torpedoes), but they do reduce the damage inflicted by successful hits.

**Torpedo damage against advanced screens:**

| ------------ | ------------------ | --------------
| **1** rolled | None               | None
