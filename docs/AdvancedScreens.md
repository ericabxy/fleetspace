Advanced Screens
----------------

### Against Batteries

Advanced screens work as normal defensive screens against beam batteries and advanced batteries.

### Against Submuntions

Submunitions are affected as if they were beams, scoring fewer hits as in [beam dice](BeamDice) rules.

### Against Torpedoes

Torpedoes hit at the same rate as normal, but against advanced screens deal less damage.

| Screen Level 1 | 
| Screen Level 2

### Against Railguns

Railguns deal damage equal to their class. Against advanced screens a railgun _may_ have a chance to deal double damage.
