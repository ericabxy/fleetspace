Beam Dice
---------

Can be abbreviated nBD where n is the number of dice rolled. For example, a Class 3 beam battery rolls 3BD at close range, 2BD at medium range, and 1BD at long range. Although these weapons refer to the amount of damage done as a result of rolling dice, its also possible to read the results as the _number of hits_ scored. In such a case standard beam batteries deal exactly 1 damage point per hit scored, and other ship systems may do something different on a per-hit basis.

| Every 1, 2, or 3 rolled | No hits
| Every 4 or 5 rolled     | One hit
| Every 6 rolled          | Two hits

The hit results of beam dice can be enhanced or degraded. The table below defines the full range of effects possible by normal, screened, and improved beam dice results.

Defensive screens reduce the number of hits by one or two grades on the table below (see columns Screen-1 and Screen-2). Interceptors and attack fighters both score hits at the maximum enhancement on the table (see column Grade-2). Level+1 is not used by any known conditions or weapon systems.

| Results        | Level+2  | Level+1  | Level 0  | Level-1  | Level-2 | Level-3

| Every 2 rolled | ---      | ---      | ---      | ---      | ---     | ---
| Every 3 rolled | One hit  | ---      | ---      | ---      | ---     | ---
| Every 4 rolled | One hit  | One hit  | One hit  | ---      | ---     | ---
